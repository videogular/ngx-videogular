**Ngx-Videogular is an HTML5 video player for Angular 2.0**. Videogular is a wrapper over the HTML5 video tag, so you can just add whatever you want. This provides a very powerful, but simple to use solution, for everybody.

## Moving from Videogular2 to Ngx-Videogular

Since `videogular2` is unmaintained, we suggest moving to `@videogular/ngx-videogular`. </br>
You can check out the [migration guide here](https://videogular.github.io/ngx-videogular/docs/migrating-from-videogular2/).

### 48% smaller bundle size? Ivy Support? </br> All of that and more!
