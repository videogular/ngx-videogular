**Ngx-Videogular is an HTML5 video player for Angular 2.0**. Videogular is a wrapper over the HTML5 video tag, so you can just add whatever you want. This provides a very powerful, but simple to use solution, for everybody.

You can see a demo here: https://videogular.github.io/videogular2-showroom/#/

Documentation: https://videogular.github.io/ngx-videogular/
